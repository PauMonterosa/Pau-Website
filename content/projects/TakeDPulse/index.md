> [!abstract] Executive Summary
> **TakeDPulse** is a high-precision digital heart-rate monitoring system that translates physiological blood-flow variations into actionable digital data. By leveraging IR photoplethysmography (PPG) and custom analog-to-digital processing, the system achieves a clinical-grade error rate of **under 3%**.

## ⚡ The Innovation: "Adaptive Light-Shielding"

What sets **TakeDPulse** apart from standard student projects is its **innovative optical isolation architecture**. 

Unlike generic sensors that suffer from ambient noise, we developed a **custom 3D-printed biometric chassis** designed with internal light-trapping geometry. This ensures that the LED-Phototransistor pair operates in a controlled environment, maximizing the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and allowing for stable readings even in high-interference environments.
