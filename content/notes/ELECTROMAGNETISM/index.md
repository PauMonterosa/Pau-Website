# ⚡ ELECTROMAGNETISM

These class notes are written by me, about the course in Electromagnetism teached by  Prof. Juan Manuel Rius and Prof. Roberto Macovez.

This module covers the vary basic mathematical foundations of classical electrodynamics, focusing on the behavior of fields in vacuum and material media.

> [!abstract] Syllabus Overview
> * **I. Maxwell’s Equations**: Foundations of the electromagnetic field in differential and integral forms.
> * **II. Electromagnetic Potentials**: Analysis of the Scalar ($\phi$) and Vector ($\mathbf{A}$) potentials under different gauges.
> * **III. Energy and Momentum**: Study of the Poynting Theorem and the conservation of energy within the field.
> * **IV. Introduction to Electromagnetic Waves**: Propagation, polarization, and behavior in conductive and dielectric media.

## 🏛️ Historical Perspective

> [!quote] 
> "From a long view of the history of mankind — seen from, say, ten thousand years from now — there can be little doubt that the most significant event of the 19th century will be judged as Maxwell's discovery of the laws of electrodynamics."
> — **Richard P. Feynman**
