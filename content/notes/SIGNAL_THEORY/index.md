> [!info] Academic Context
> These notes were authored during the third year of the **Engineering Physics** bachelor's degree. This subject represents a fundamental pillar in the degree, bridging the gap between pure mathematical transformations and real-world physical data processing.

> [!abstract] Subject Description
> Signal Theory focuses on the representation, transformation, and analysis of information-bearing signals. The course transitions from the deterministic analysis of **LTI systems** and **Spectral Analysis** (Fourier, DFT) to the statistical framework of **Estimation Theory** and **Optimal Filtering** (Wiener, LMS), providing the tools necessary to extract signals from noise in physical systems.
